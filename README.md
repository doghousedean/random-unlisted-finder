# Random Unlisted Video Finder

This works but will probably trigger a bot detector on youtube and get yourself banned, could add a crazy long timer I guess but probably no point

## HOWTO

just run the script through python3

`./rand-unlisted.py`

couple of options in the file:

	1) number of tries
	2) filename for output
	3) delay in seconds between checks

simply edit the variables, straigth forward enough
